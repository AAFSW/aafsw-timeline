# AAFSW Timeline
## A volunteer project for AAFSW in 2021

This is a timeline project that uses the Knight Labs Timeline.js (http://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/index.html) project to create a multi-decade presentation of historical highlights about the Associates of the American Foreign Service Worldwide (AAFSW).

### Editing Styles

It is possible to change the appearance of the timeline by editing the CSS file. An explanation of this is available at: https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/overriding-styles.html

The final project will be embedded on a WordPress site as a subdomain of AAFSW.org.
