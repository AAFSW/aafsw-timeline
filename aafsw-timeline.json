June Byrne Spencer suggested the creation of an organization, removed from considerations of rank, which would represent families at every level. It was clear that women and families in the Foreign Service community needed a voice.</p>"

This reactivated the wives’ course at FSI.  In November 1962, FSI offered a pilot two-week course for wives called 'Overseas Assignment.'</p>"
