This reactivated the wives’ course at FSI.  In November 1962, FSI offered a pilot two-week course for wives called 'Overseas Assignment.'</p>"

The result was that wives began to talk about working, since their time was now their own. Furthermore, they dared to speak freely about concerns for themselves and their children, since they were no longer being evaluated. AAFSW was not involved in the creation of this directive, but it proved to be a catalyst for future AAFSW initiatives.</p>"

                "text": "<p>Perhaps the most significant recommendation of AAFSW’s FORUM report was to establish the Family Liaison Office (FLO). The AAFSW engaged in direct dialogue with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance on this matter.  In 1978, the Family Liaison Office was opened to considerable publicity with a big reception, attended by the Secretary of State and Mrs. Vance, members of Congress and the press. Thus, the AAFSW, a volunteer group, managed to change the structure of the bureaucracy and to insert a new function–that of the FLO. This was a major accomplishment which helped to change the face of the Foreign Service. When the Office was scarcely two years old, then-Under Secretary for Management Ben Read wrote that the FLO had \"already become an accepted and essential part of Department operations.\"</p>"

It was suggested that medical personnel in Washington should better recognize the stresses of Foreign Service life and be more sensitive in their dealings with family members. AAFSW organized a Mental Health panel discussion in March 1978 to address these concerns, including panelists from AID, State and USIA as well as medical professionals. First Lady Rosalynn Carter was a guest speaker at the event.</p>"

The program was eventually rebranded into the Expanded Professional Associates Program (EPAP), which is still active.</p>"
